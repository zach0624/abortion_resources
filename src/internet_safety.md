title: Being Safe on the Internet
---

Staying safe on the internet, which includes messaging, is very important. When connecting to a website various servers
will track your data from your ISP to the website you're accessing. Additionally, there are cookies and scripts that will
follow your activity on the web such as scripts from Facebook and Google. Even with Google promising to not release information
about searches for abortion to authorities it is always safer to maintain a smaller footprint online.

It is important to pick a secure messaging app. Most apps, including SMS apps, don't encrypt your data end to end meaning the
service can read your messages. This opens you up not only to hacking but also to requests from law enforcement. Even some apps
that encrypt your messages can still provide limited information to law enforcement, WhatsApp and iMessage are examples of

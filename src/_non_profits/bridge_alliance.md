The Bridge Alliance is an organization that provides logistical support for people seeking abortions.
This organization prioritizes people seeking abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy because these procedures
are often much more expensive and harder to access, often involving longer travel and time off work.
The Bridge Alliance works with partners to get clients transportation, lodging, meal assistance and child care
while they seek an abortion and provide support and coordination between the client, provider, support person,
and caregiver during travel.

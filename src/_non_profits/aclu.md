The ACLU is a non-profit organization founded in 1920. It is one of the most well known
non-profits in the US and fights for civil rights and liberties via litigation and lobbying.
One of the major areas where the ACLU focuses is on abortion rights and both lobbies and litigates
in favor of expanded abortion rights.
